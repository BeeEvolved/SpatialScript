## SpatialScript Coding Language Specifications: Syntax, Semantics, and Core Features

### Syntax Design

SpatialScript's syntax aims to provide a clear and intuitive representation of code elements within the immersive AR/VR environment. It blends traditional programming concepts with spatial interactions, allowing developers to manipulate code blocks and programming constructs in a three-dimensional space. The syntax should strike a balance between readability and expressiveness while leveraging the spatial computing paradigm.

**Code Blocks**: In SpatialScript, code is represented as tangible objects or blocks that can be physically manipulated within the virtual environment. Each block corresponds to a specific programming construct, such as functions, loops, conditionals, or variables. The blocks can be visually connected to establish relationships and control flow between different components of the code.

**Gestural Interactions**: Hand gestures play a crucial role in SpatialScript's syntax. Developers can use gestures to pick up, move, rotate, or connect code blocks in the virtual space. For example, a grabbing gesture can be used to select a block, while a twisting motion can rotate it. Gesture recognition algorithms interpret these movements and map them to relevant programming actions.

**Voice Commands**: SpatialScript incorporates voice commands to complement gestural interactions. Developers can use natural language commands to execute code, modify variables, or trigger specific functionalities. For instance, saying "run code" can initiate code execution, while saying "create variable" followed by a variable name will create a new variable block.

### Semantics and Core Features

SpatialScript's semantics define how code blocks interact and operate within the AR/VR environment. It encompasses the behavior of programming constructs and the rules governing their execution.

**Spatial Context**: SpatialScript utilizes the physical space and relationships within the AR/VR environment as an integral part of its semantics.
